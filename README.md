**Credit Card Transaction Data Analysis Project**

**Overview**
This project utilizes SQL and Business Intelligence (BI) techniques to analyze credit card transaction data and generate actionable insights. Through organized data modeling and query development, the project aims to deliver intuitive dashboards and summary reports that facilitate efficient monitoring and decision-making around credit card operations.

**Project Objectives**
Design an end-to-end data pipeline for ingestion, cleaning, and analysis of financial transaction data.

Create a robust relational database schema that supports diverse queries and reporting needs.

Build SQL queries and visualizations to highlight trends, key metrics, and operational insights.

Foster data-driven decision-making and process improvement in financial management contexts.

**Features**
Schema design for credit cards, users, branches, limits, and applications.

Example SQL scripts for table creation, data insertion, and basic analysis.

Use cases for monitoring balances, transaction volumes, and card types.

Foundation for BI dashboards (expandable in tools like Power BI, Tableau, etc.).

Modularity for future enhancements such as additional metrics, machine learning, or multi-source data integration.
